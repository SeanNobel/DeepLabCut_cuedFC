![media](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75618251/102006196-90c74580-3d62-11eb-94df-ecefa19dd4b8.gif)

Analyze freezing rate and other behavioral aspects of animals, using data from DeepLabCut. Especially optimized for cued fear conditioning.
You need videos and corresponding csv files. (you need to set save_as_csv parameter True: deeplabcut.analyze_videos(save_as_csv=True))

I initially wrote the codes just to use by myself. It's under modification to be friendly for other users, but will take a while.
Feel free to contact and tell me what kind of modification would be beneficial or usable.
