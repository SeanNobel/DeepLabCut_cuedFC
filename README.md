Analyze freezing rate and other behavioral aspects of animals, using data from DeepLabCut. Especially optimized for cued fear conditioning.
You need videos and corresponding h5 and csv files. (h5,csv files are results of deeplabcut.analyze_videos())

I initially wrote the codes just to use by myself. It's under modification to be friendly for other users, but will take a while.
Feel free to contact and tell me what kind of modification would be beneficial or usable.
